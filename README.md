This repository holds replication code for the following study:  

Liddie, J.M., Bind, M.A., Karra, M., Sunderland, E.M. County-Level Associations between Drinking Water PFAS Contamination and COVID-19 Mortality in the United States. Journal of Exposure Science & Environmental Epidemiology (2024) DOI: 10.1038/s41370-024-00723-5 doi: 10.1038/s41370-024-00723-5

Files are numbered according to the order in which they are run for the main analyses, sensitivity analyses (including propensity score matching), and table/figure generation. Replication datasets and additional descriptions of the data are available on the Harvard Dataverse here[https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/PN0RI5].
